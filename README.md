 # Client-Centric Document Generator with CRM Integration

This project aims to streamline document generation for trip guide organizations by providing a client-centric approach with seamless CRM integration.

## Problem Statement

<p align="justify">  In a trip guide organisation, handling numerous clients manually can become an overwhelming endeavor for administrators. Crafting customized travel or project proposals in offline documents introduces complexities like inconsistent formatting, font-related dilemmas, and difficulties with proper indentation. These hurdles often result in inefficiencies and inaccuracies during the proposal creation process.

Additionally, the system will facilitate the inclusion of cost estimates for their trips and provide a platform to specify the destinations they intend to visit. This ensures a comprehensive overview of the proposed travel plans for both clients and administrators. </p>

## Solution Overview

To address these issues, we've developed a form-based document generator using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This solution offers the following features:

- **Client Management:** The administrator has the authority to create and manage clients, providing a centralized hub for client information.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The form-based approach simplifies the document creation process for administrators, eliminating common formatting concerns.

- **Document Customization:** Administrators can edit the form fields to ensure accurate and tailored proposals before generating the final document.

## Technology Stack

This project is implemented using the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB:** Database for storing client and document data.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **React.js:** Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
